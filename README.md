## System Overview
-**Description:**[ Soil moisture monitor with local alerting. When LED 'alerts' are solid 
                   this means the soil moisture is sufficient. When the LED 'alerts' blink
                   this means the user should add water to the soil until the respective LED
                   goes from blinking to solid.]
